        "This guide is for novice users interested in analyzing data that varies based on the city. Organizations, LA County, and cities  collect a variety of **time-based** data. Time-based data has at least one column with a year, month, or day in it. In this example, we'll analyze a dataset on when Los Angeles artists created public projects – like the mural above. This gives us a better sense of the history of public art in the city, and barriers to its preservation. \n",
