Time-based data has at least one column with a year, month, or day in it. In this example, we'll analyze a data set on public art in the City of Los Angeles – like the mural above – to see when these artworks were created. This gives us a better sense of how the history of public art has unfolded in the city, and barriers to its preservation. \n",
