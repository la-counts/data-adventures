        "Everyone who uses a smartphone knows about location tracking. When you hail a Lyft or ask Google Maps for directions, your smartphone uses your GPS (Global Positioning System) location. Data analyses can also use location data to help you better understand what is going on in a particular geographic area. For example, you could map all the taco stands in your neighborhood. Data visualization tools have steadily improved over the last decade. Thanks to a robust set of Python libraries, anyone can now create maps using geographic data! \n",
