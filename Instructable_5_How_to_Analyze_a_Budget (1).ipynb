        "This guide is for anyone interested in analyzing budget data. Where does the money go? Residents often wonder how much the city spends on what types of goods and services. Typically budget datasets will have a column for type of expenditures, and a column for amount of money spent. Each row represents a different expenditure. For this exercise, we will use data from the Los Angeles City Controller, Ron Galperin, who has long been a thought leader in making data openly available to the public. We will be using the \"high-level\" version of the budget, which presents most expensive categories of expenditures. \n",

We selected this file because it has high-level summaries of expenditures. We can also tell from the \"provenance\" field that it is an official data set from the city of Los Angeles. There are other ways to view city expenditures, such as the [general fund revenue](https://www.lacounts.org/dataset/general-fund-revenue) data set. However, this data set is much larger because it contains line-item expenditures and has more fields than we need. \n",
