        "The first step in any data analysis is to find data you are interested in analyzing. Historically, it has been difficult to find data sets. Governments have tended to release data only when convenient, and even basic information about community health can be difficult to find. More recently, [LA Counts](http://lacounts.org/), an open data platform supported by the California Community Foundation, has made a wide range of data available for free. It is built on CKAN, an open-source data platform that makes finding and downloading data easy. \n",

Maybe you are a parent concerned about access to quality schools, a journalist writing a story about a recent event, or a community organizer interested in using data to get statistics for an upcoming grant submission. Perhaps you're just curious about learning more about what specific problems, like poor air quality, affect your neighborhood. In all of these cases, you're using data for advocating for social change. Think of a question like this – about education, immigration, or the environment – and move on to step 2. "
