        "Which council districts are shouldering a greater burden for managing the homeless crisis? Los Angeles County is in the midst of a [homelessness crisis](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-homeless-county-letter-20190608-story.html). The most recent count of people who lack reliable housing showed a statistically significant increase in many areas. In total, the number of people living in the streets [rose 12%](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/04/los-angeles-homeless-population-up-12-amid-affordable-housing-crisis/1336734001/) to a total of 58,936. In 2018, voters passed Measure HHH, a $1.2 billion initiative to build houses. However, the burden for the crisis is not shared equally throughout the city. Certain neighborhoods and council districts have disproportionately more homeless than others. This presents a challenge for both budgeting and use of public space. \n",

        "Congratulations, you just learned how to analyze data across multiple data sets! From the above table, we can see that District 14 (Downtown and Boyle Heights, councilman Jose Huizar) is the most impacted â€“ with nearly 35 residents for each homeless person. As should not come as a surprise, District 14 includes the high-density homeless area referred to as \"skid row.\" District 3 (the San Fernando Valley, councilman Bob Blumenfield) is the least impacted â€“Â with approximately 492 residents for each homeless person. Some questions you might ask from here include: \n",
        "\n",
        "* What are the underlying reasons why certain districts are more impacted than others? \n",
        "* How might you use this data to advocate for more attention to housing issues in Los Angeles? \n",
        "* Could you use this data to create a graph, like in [one of our earlier data instructables](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G1mSsjMeVQmmPO2Wo0qr88Uy88n9_8ae)? \n",
